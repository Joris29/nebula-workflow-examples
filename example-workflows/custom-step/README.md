# Custom Step Tutorial

This workflow provides a Tutorial of writing your own steps in Nebula. Use it to familiarize yourself 
with the features built-in to Nebula to get access to things like parameters, secrets, and outputs. 

The workflow should appear on the **Workflows** page in your Nebula web interface. If you don't see it there, add the workflow from our [examples repo](https://github.com/puppetlabs/nebula-workflow-examples/tree/master/example-workflows/sample-workflow) on GitHub.

## Running the Workflow 
To run the workflow from the Nebula web interface, click **Workflows** > **sample-workflow** > **Run**. After the run initiates, the run page opens.

You can access the following information from the sample workflow run page:
-  Click **Graph** to view a visualization of the workflow.
-  Click **Code and data** to view the YAML for the workflow.
-  Click **Logs** and select a step to view the log output for that step.
